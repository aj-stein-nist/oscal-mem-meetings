## Ground Rules

- Keep the discussion respectful​
- Using welcoming and inclusive language​
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences​
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism​
- Focusing on what is best for the community​
- Wait for one speaker to finish before speaking - one speaker at a time​
- Speak from your own experience instead of generalizing ("I" instead of "they," "we," and "you").​
    - Do not be afraid to respectfully challenge one another by asking questions - focus on ideas.​

- The goal is not to always to agree -- it is to gain a deeper understanding.
