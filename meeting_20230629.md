# Model Engineering Meeting

---

## Purpose and Goals

Purpose

- Facilitate an open, ongoing dialog with the OSCAL developer and user communities to promote increased use of the OSCAL models​

Goals

- Answer questions about implementing and using the OSCAL models, and around development of OSCAL model-based content​
- Review development priorities and adjust priorities based on community input​

---

## Meeting Overview

- Ground Rules
- OSCAL Status Summary
- Site and Artifact Reorganization Spike
- Questions and Open Discussion
    - Submitted questions first
    - New questions and live discussion​ second
---

## Ground Rules

- Keep the discussion respectful​
- Using welcoming and inclusive language​
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences​
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism​
- Focusing on what is best for the community​
- Wait for one speaker to finish before speaking - one speaker at a time​
- Speak from your own experience instead of generalizing ("I" instead of "they," "we," and "you").​
    - Do not be afraid to respectfully challenge one another by asking questions - focus on ideas.​

- The goal is not to always to agree -- it is to gain a deeper understanding.

---

- Need more model review: schemas, documentation gaps, etc.​
- Let us know about your experiences implementing OSCAL​
- Identify cookbook recipes/tutorial priorities

---

## Site and Artifact Reorganization Spike

- Expectations around spikes
- Full technical details in [issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/1802) and [developer branch](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/feature-1802-oscal-pages)
- We're prototying how we can
  - manage [model reference docs](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/reference/) and other site content separately
  - publish schemas and release artifacts separately from :point_up:

---

## Site and Artifact Reorganization Spike

- Even if we change, we want to:
  - still have [generated assets in builds](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/actions)
  - still have those [assets in releases](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases)
  - publish the assets on the reference site

---

## Site and Artifact Reorganization Spike

- Even if we change, we want to hear from you!
  - Do you use the schemas or converters committed into the repository?
  - If we do not commit those into the repo and publish them in releases, will it cause you problems?

---

## Open Floor

- What would you like to discuss?​
- What questions do you have?​
- Should we be covering anything differently?

---
