# Model Engineering Meeting

---

## Purpose and Goals

Purpose

- Facilitate an open, ongoing dialog with the OSCAL developer and user communities to promote increased use of the OSCAL models​

Goals

- Provide up-to-date status of the OSCAL project development activities​
- Answer questions about implementing and using the OSCAL models, and around development of OSCAL model-based content​
- Review development priorities and adjust priorities based on community input​

---

## Meeting Overview

- Ground Rules
- OSCAL Status Summary
- Website and Release Changes Briefing
- Questions and Open Discussion
    - Submitted questions first
    - New questions and live discussion​ second
---

## Ground Rules

- Keep the discussion respectful​
- Using welcoming and inclusive language​
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences​
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism​
- Focusing on what is best for the community​
- Wait for one speaker to finish before speaking - one speaker at a time​
- Speak from your own experience instead of generalizing ("I" instead of "they," "we," and "you").​
    - Do not be afraid to respectfully challenge one another by asking questions - focus on ideas.​

- The goal is not to always to agree -- it is to gain a deeper understanding.

---

## Work Review

  - Current sprint​
  - Next month’s sprint​
  - Backlog (new and existing issues not in sprint)

---

## Help Needed

- Please review pull requests and comment on issues you are interested in.​
- Need more model review: schemas, documentation gaps, etc.​
- Let us know about your experiences implementing OSCAL​
- Identify cookbook recipes/tutorial priorities

---

## Website and Release Changes Briefing

### We currently have:

1. OSCAL Models
2. OSCAL Public Website
3. OSCAL Reference

- ADR:  https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/feature-1802-oscal-pages/decisions/0005-repository-reorganization.md

---

## Website and Release Changes Briefing

### This corresponds to the following repositories:

1. **OSCAL**
    - Developer focused metaschema modeling for OSCAL itself.
    - OSCAL is the `product` produced from source.
2. **OSCAL-Pages**
    - Public focused site about OSCAL, getting involved and first steps.
    - Updates can occur as needed without crossing paths in development.
3. **OSCAL-Reference**
    - Implementer focused reference site, typical of API documentation.
    - Opportunity to grow the tools for exploring, understanding and using the models.
    - Produced for each tagged version.
    - Also able to update without impacting other streams of work.

---

## Website and Release Changes Briefing

### A few changes.

- Releases of schemas and converters will not be auto-committed.
  - `xml/`
  - `json/`
- A problem if you link directly to source in `main` and/or `develop`
- Will become release assets, available through versioned links.
- Reference links will land on a "link has moved" page.

- ***We want to do this as soon as possible to organize for model development.***

---

## Open Floor

- What would you like to discuss?​
- What questions do you have?​
- Should we be covering anything differently?
